# 1.	Gautam Gambhir, freshly appointed head coach for India’s 2025 away Test series against England, has asked the new analyst, Aryan, to keep a quirky statistic:
# “At the end of each day’s play,” Gambhir says, “tell me the total runs we scored in every odd-numbered over—1st, 3rd, 5th … all the way up to the last over bowled that day. It helps me spot momentum in the sessions where bowlers are freshest.”
# Aryan realises the job boils down to simple maths: if n is the last over of the day (always a positive integer), he just needs the sum of all odd integers from 1 through n.
# Your task is to step into Aryan’s shoes and automate this little ritual.
# Input Format:
# A single integer
# Output Format:
# A single integer: the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to n
