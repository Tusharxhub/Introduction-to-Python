# 2.	A high-security vault uses a custom PIN authentication mechanism. To reduce the chances of brute-force attacks, the system only allows PINs that are Neon Numbers.
# The rule is:
# A PIN is valid if the sum of the digits of its square equals the PIN itself.
# Your Task: Write a Python program that reads a numeric PIN input by the user and validates whether it is a Neon Number or not.
# Sample Test Cases

# 	Input	Output
# Test Case 1	9	Neon Number
# Test Case 2	12	Not Neon Number
# Test Case 3	10	Not Neon Number
# Test Case 4	0	Neon Number
# Test Case 5	1	Neon Number
# Test Case 6	2	Not Neon Number
